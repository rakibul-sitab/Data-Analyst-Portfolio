# Udacity-Projects:
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under udacity online platform.

## Project 1 : Exploring Weather Trends
This project is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where i live.I was provided a dataset from udacity. I found out Dhaka city is way more hotter comparing to global average through this project.
