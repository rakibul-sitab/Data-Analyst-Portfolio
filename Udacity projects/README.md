# Udacity-Projects:
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under udacity online platform.

## Project 1 : Exploring Weather Trends
This project is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where i live.I was provided a dataset from udacity. I found out Dhaka city is way more hotter comparing to global average through this project.

## Project 2 : Investigate a Dataset (TMDb Movie Data)
We choose the TMDb movie data set for data analysis. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),we would like to find intresting patterns in the dataset.


## Project 3 : Understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website
The project goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.The data set have been collected from udacity.

## Project 4 : Wrangle & Analyze WeRateDogs Data

The purpose of this project is to put into practice what Iâ€™ve learned in Data wrangling data course which is part of Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program.
