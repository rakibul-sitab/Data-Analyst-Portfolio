# Udacity-Projects:
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under udacity online platform.

## Project 1 : Exploring Weather Trends
This project is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where i live.I was provided a dataset from udacity. I found out Dhaka city is way more hotter comparing to global average through this project.

## Project 2 : Investigate a Dataset (TMDb Movie Data)
We choose the TMDb movie data set for data analysis. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),we would like to find intresting patterns in the dataset.
