## Project 1: Report preparation for a bank's-loan division
This project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division.I was provided a dataset from Practicum100 which is based on some data on customers’ credit worthiness. I found out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan.My report have been considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.I complete the entire data analysis process by sharing the findings.
