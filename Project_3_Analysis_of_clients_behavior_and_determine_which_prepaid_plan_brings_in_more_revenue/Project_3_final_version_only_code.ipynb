Glad to see that notebook is well-structured and such a detailed overall conclusion. I've left some comments in colored blocks that could help you to improve your analytical project and coding. We are almost there, only a couple of minor issues are here, but I believe, you can easily handle them ;) waiting for your fixes and come back soon =)"

Most of the users from New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA MSA and Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA MSA area.But average highest revenue comes from Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY MSA area.So this area is very important for the company's profit.\n",
